# Fetal-Health-Classification

- Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.
- This project follows KDD process, which stands for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. This process of extracting useful knowledge from large amounts of data aims to identify hidden patterns, relationships, and trends in data that can be used to make predictions, decisions, and recommendations. The KDD process involves a range of techniques and methodologies, including data preprocessing, data transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation, and knowledge representation. KDD and data mining are closely related processes, with data mining being a key component and subset of the KDD process.
- The purpose of this project is to create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.
